# bootdev_mazesolver

Project for the [bootdev](https://boot.dev) python course.

From the course descprition, I will build a maze and then solve it, rendered with Tkinter.

I used nvim for this tool and Python 3.12.0 as the latest LTS edition of Python at time of creation.
Python version controlled with pyenv so not reliant on the Debian Package version installed in system.
